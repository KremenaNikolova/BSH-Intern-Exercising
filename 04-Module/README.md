## Task

Use ASP.Net Core to create a web page for a customer which should contain the following fields: **first name, last name, email, gender, country, city, phone, birth date**. 

1. **First name**, **last name** and **email** field are mandatory.
2.	The **email** field should be automatically validated and would notify the user if the email is invalid.
3.	The **phone number** field should expect a user input in the following format: XXX-XXX-XXXX
4.	The **gende**r field should allow the user to select one between two values.
5.	The **city** and **country** fields should contain a list of items (please use hardcoded values) and should allow the user to select one value per field.
6.	The **birth date** field should display a simple **calendar** control and shouldnâ€™t allow the user to input invalid dates.
7. After setting up your page, please insert data into the table from **Lab 3**.

I have added an additional page where all registered users are displayed and functionality that checks if a user with that email already exists.
