## Task

1. Create a small database for an online shop. You should have tables with data for:

- Products that should contain **product name, category, price, quantity**;
- Categories - **category name**;
- Customers - f**irst and last names, email, gender, country, city, phone, birthdate**;

2. After setting up your tables and relations, please:

- Insert dummy data to the above tables (_you can use the Customers data from Module 1_).
- Find the names of all the products from a certain category;
- List **names of customers** and **products they have bought**, along with the **title of the productâ€™s category**. If customers have not bought any products, **show the title as null**;
- Make a query that returns the **most wanted product**;
